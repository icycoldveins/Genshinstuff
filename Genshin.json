Why? Because it is 100% community votes. And in order to regulate their freemogems, hoyoverse won't just casually throw them out just because the fanbase flexed its presence in a contest. \n\nIt would create an expectation that they will reward any wins in any popularity contest but also invalidate (somewhat) the game's value because people will vote for the rewards rather than their honest feelings on the game itself. \n\nWe are already seeing this with the players' voice voting, people mocking the community because we are supposedly being bribed--we don't want that moving forward, do we? The stigma won't disappear but at least let's not let that be the defining factor of the fanbase.\n\nThe reason, in my opinion, why the Best Mobile and\/or Best Ongoing are treated differently is because there are reputable judges evaluating the game. Their recognition means more compared to a group of people with multiple (probably) accounts.\n\nI'm putting it here just so people are aware and be mature about it rather than throw a tantrum.\n.\n.\n.\nNow that I'm done with that...\n\nHold the line comrades! Our god of salt, Havria, shall be revived at last. May salt spread through the lands and the taste of salt reign forevermore.\n\nMwahahaha","timestamp":1670304115000},{"title":"My Sucrose cosplay","score":2379,"id":"ze4pwo","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/gwfuzfylo94a1.jpg","comms_num":29,"created":1670327841.0,"body":"","timestamp":1670309841000},{"title":"The little dude thinks he's part of the team","score":2258,"id":"zdxptj","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/jqrdt1zlz74a1.png","comms_num":34,"created":1670307305.0,"body":"","timestamp":1670289305000},{"title":"800 days without Qiqi except I actually want her","score":2035,"id":"zdo4x7","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/o9z1nr15064a1.jpg","comms_num":218,"created":1670283276.0,"body":"","timestamp":1670265276000},{"title":"Players' Voice or Robots' Voice?
