we might not get primogems,2563,ze2plj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/ze2plj/we_might_not_get_primogems/,408,1670322115.0,"Just so we are clear, this is for the TGA Players' Voice award. 

There's a high chance we will get primos if we win Best Mobile and/or Best Ongoing but not so much on Players' Voice. Why? Because it is 100% community votes. And in order to regulate their freemogems, hoyoverse won't just casually throw them out just because the fanbase flexed its presence in a contest. 

It would create an expectation that they will reward any wins in any popularity contest but also invalidate (somewhat) the game's value because people will vote for the rewards rather than their honest feelings on the game itself. 

We are already seeing this with the players' voice voting, people mocking the community because we are supposedly being bribed--we don't want that moving forward, do we? The stigma won't disappear but at least let's not let that be the defining factor of the fanbase.

The reason, in my opinion, why the Best Mobile and/or Best Ongoing are treated differently is because there are reputable judges evaluating the game. Their recognition means more compared to a group of people with multiple (probably) accounts.

I'm putting it here just so people are aware and be mature about it rather than throw a tantrum.

Hold the line comrades! Our god of salt, Havria, shall be revived at last. May salt spread through the lands and the taste of salt reign forevermore.
